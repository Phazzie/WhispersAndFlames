# Whispers and Flames

This is a Next.js application designed to foster intimacy and connection through guided, thought-provoking conversations.

## How it Works

Players create or join a private room, select conversation categories and a "spicy level," and then answer a series of AI-generated questions designed to spark deeper connection. At the end of the session, a personalized summary of the conversation is generated.
